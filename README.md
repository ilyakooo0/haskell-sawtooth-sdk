# Haskell Sawtooth SDK

A limited, but very safe and _such_ typelevel SDK for the [Hyperledger Sawtooth](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org) blockchain framework.

There is currently no real documentation or examples, but that is only because I seriously doubt that anyone will actually have a use for this library. If you think this library might be useful to you, feel free to open an issue requesting documentation for the library.
